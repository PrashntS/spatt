TODO list
---------
* add fast_log_pcpoi and fast_log_qcpoi 
* new cp function could fail when n=0 is supplied
* add reading from standard input in order to use spatt with pipe
* add a progression bar for long computations (ex: xspatt)
* rewrite the transition class (to have a better sparse structure of matrices)
* get rid of "natt" for expected number of occurrences
* support for extreme pvalues using smart factorizations in oldxstat
* change rank evaluation to something smarter in gstat
* change serie convergence to something smarter in oldxstat
* replace the bracketing function by the one from the gsl
* incorporate the gsl sources needed in the distribution
* remove gsl_cdf.h from cdf.h (just have to replace call to gsl_cdfnor
by call to erf function from the math lib)
* add more tests (normalize, nobs, patterns, etc ...)
* compute _ell0 using cpstat in xstat (_tail_sum case)
* replace zgeev by dgeev in markov.cc and then remove zgeev.f (and unused dependancies
from the project)
* add an option to output e-value instead of p-value when multi-test are
performed
* use map (may be with a pooled memory allocator) to work with
all-words of fixed length L when L > 12. could be useful along
with the "-min-freq 1" option to limit dramatically the number of
word to process.
* add shuffle option in gspatt
* count the number of sequence in the fasta file in order to take it
into account for the effective length : n-nseq*(h-1) instead of the
usual n-h+1
* degenerate pattern support must be added to cpspatt (tough but doable)
* twisted matrix support must be added to ldspatt
* output count in a file
(using grep pattern helping to get counts for
a given length)
* add option for output format and p-value scaling
(normal, log scale, normalized, gaussian scale)
