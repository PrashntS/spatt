	as an array

	* libspatt2/xstat.cc: added a method accepting the sequence length
	instead of the sequence it-self

	instead of the sequence it-self

2008-05-23  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@turing.math-info.univ-paris5.fr>

	* Spatt release 2.0-pre7

	stationary distribution

	* libspatt/gstat.cc: added support for Markov model with no
	stationary distribution
	

2008-02-05  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@turing.math-info.univ-paris5.fr>

	* SPatt release 2.0-pre6
	
	* libspatt2/xstat.cc: changed the presence/abscence code to avoid
	redondant computations

2007-12-03  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@turing.math-info.univ-paris5.fr>

	* SPatt release 2.0-pre5

	* Corrected a rare bug with pmc state recoding for order 2 or more
	Markov chains

	* Added an indexed output useful for thrid party programs

	* Added default markov constructor without file parameter

2007-06-28  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@genopole.cnrs.fr>

	* SPatt release 2.0-pre4

	* Changed code in xstat.cc and gstat.cc in order to avoid
	redondance between stationary and non stationary computations

	* Added a "presence" option to compute presence/absence statistics
	in a set of sequences

2007-06-27  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@genopole.cnrs.fr>

	* Added a "--offset" option to specify an offset in conjunction
	with the ignore-interrupt option

2007-01-25  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@genopole.cnrs.fr>

	* SPatt release 2.0-pre3

	* Fixed segfault when encountring a sequence shorter than model
	order
	
	* Added a "--ignore-interrupt" option to force spatt to ignore
	sequence interruptions. This option is yet only implemented for
	Gaussian approximations.

2007-01-18  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@genopole.cnrs.fr>

	* SPatt release 2.0-pre2
	
	* Changed option "-nocc" in "-nobs". All "nocc"
	occurrences in sourcecode have been changed accordingly.

	* Added a "--stationary" option to force spatt to assume that all
	Markov chains are stationary.

2006-11-20  Gregory Nuel  <nuel@genopole.cnrs.fr>

	* SPatt release 2.0-pre1
	
	* Added a class alphabet:
	- char to code
	- code to char
	- includes both pattern and sequence char syntax

	* Added a class sequence
	- easy interface to one or more sequence files

	* Added a class nfa:
	- build a nfa from a pattern

	* Added a class dfa:
	- build a dfa from a nfa (subset construction)
	- minimize a dfa (Hopcroft algorithm)
	- switch to renewal counting
	- remove ambiguity

	* Added a class pmc:
	- build a pmc from a dfa and Markov parameter
	- vector matrix product
	- scalar vector matrix product

	* Added a class markov:
        - build a markov from a file
	- build a markov in the m=0 uniform case
        - normalize

	* Added a class vmarkov:
	- compute mean and covariance matrix of (N_m,N_{m+1})

	* Added class stat:
	- from which all *stat are derived

	* Added a class xstat:
	- compute exact pvalue for nocc

	* Added a class gstat:
	- compute gaussian z-score

	* Added a class xwaiting
	- compute exact pvalue for waiting times
	
2006-11-13  Mark Hoebeke  <mhoebeke@localhost.localdomain>

	* Added license info to *.cc and *.h files.

	* Added namespace declaration to avoid name collisions (e.g. stat on Win32/MinGW platforms).
