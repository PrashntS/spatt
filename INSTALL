I. Binary Distribution

II. Source Distribution

-----------------------


I. Binary Distribution
----------------------

Requirements
------------

A system matching the one used for the compilation.

For example, with a linux_i586 build you will need 
a linux system on i586 hardware compatible processor.

Installing and using the package
--------------------------------

A simple

tar zxvf spatt-x.x.x_static_OS_SYSTEM.tar.gz

will decompress the package. Then you can immediatly
use the binaries or consult the man page.

II. Source Distribution
-----------------------

Requirements
------------

All you need is:
- automake/autoconf
- a C/C++ compiler
- a Fortran 77 compiler

For your convenience, all non standard necessary
library (argtable2, blas, lapack) have been
included in the package

Package has already been successfully compiled
on the following hardware/software combination:
- x86/Linux
- Sun/Solaris

Should be compiled but on the following combination
(but have not been tested yet):

- Macintosh/Mac Os X
- x86/Windows

Building the Package
--------------------

a simple

	./configure
	make

would do the job

Checking the package
--------------------

You can check the binaries using

	make check

IMPORTANT REMARK: As ldspatt uses stochastic algorithms, the ldspatt test may failed.
If the differences are small enough (let say at least the first two digits are the same)
then, the package could be installed anyway.

Installing the package
----------------------

To install the package simple use

	make install
