Spatt Installation
==================

Spatt is distributed with *CMakeLists.txt* files for CMake_, the cross-platform, open-source build system.

For example, to compile and install **Spatt** on a Unix system:

1. To create the *Makefiles* do:

 ::

  cd spatt-<version>
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..

 .. note::

    **Spatt** requires the **Tclap** headers. If they are not installed in your system, you can specify the path where you have a local copy of them:

    ::

     cmake -DTCLAP_INCLUDEDIR=<path>/tclap-1.2.1/include ..

 .. note::

    To compile the shared library together with **spatt** executable:

    ::

     cmake -DWITH_SHARED_LIB=ON ..

2. To compile do:

 ::

  make

 Or to have a more verbose output (every compiling line):

 ::

  VERBOSE=1 make

3. To install the library and the executable, do ``make install``.
